## 0.4.2 - February 16, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* [#16](https://github.com/sdss/basecam/issues/16) Use JSONSchema validation for actor keyword datamodel. The datamodel of the actor has been updated. The schema should work for all CLU actors, including `LegacyActor` although in this case the keywords will be flattened into a list.
* `CardGroup` now accepts string items that are evaluated to default cards.
* Complete version of the documentation.

### âœ¨ Improved

## 0.4.1 - February 13, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* Allow `MacroCard.macro` to return `Card` or `CardGroup`.

## 0.4.0 - February 12, 2021

### ðŸš€ New

* `Card` now accepts a `type` to which to be cast. By default `autocast=True` will try to cast the value to the correct type after evaluating.
